# Admission-Prediction-lr
Predicting chance of admission using linear regression technique.
This is my first project on which I am working from scratch. This data set has been analysed, cleaned and then used for training the model. 
I will further deploy this model by connecting it through API and host it on Heroku and paste the link in this readme  section itself.
